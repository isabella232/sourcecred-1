 * Convert a string repository spec into a project.

 * The spec may take one of two forms:
 * - $REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME, as in 'sourcecred-test/example-github'
 * - @$REPO_OWNER, as in '@sourcecred'
 *
 * In either case, we will create a project with the spec as its
 * id. In the first construction, the project will have a single
 * RepoId, matching the spec string. In the second construction,
 * the project will have a RepoId for every repository owned by that
 * owner.
 *
 * A valid GitHub token must be provided, so that it's possible to
 * enumerate the repos for an org.
