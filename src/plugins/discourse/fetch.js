 * Class for retrieving data from the Discourse API.

 * The Discourse API implements the JSON endpoints for all functionality of the actual site.
 * As such, it tends to return a lot of information that we don't care about (in contrast
 * to a GraphQL API which would give us only what we ask for). As such, we implement a simple
 * interface over it, which both abstracts over calling the API, and does some post-processing
 * on the results to simplify it to data that is relevant for us.
